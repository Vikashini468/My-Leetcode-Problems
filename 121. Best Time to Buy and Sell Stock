This problem is solved by using Two pointer approach.
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # Initialize variables
        min_price = float('inf')  # To track the minimum price so far
        max_profit = 0           # To track the maximum profit

        # Traverse the prices array
        for price in prices:
            # Update the minimum price if the current price is lower
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            else:
                # Calculate profit and update max profit if needed
                max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        
        return max_profit
